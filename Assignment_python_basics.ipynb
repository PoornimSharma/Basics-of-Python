        "- python is a programming language which is used to perform desired tasks and functions.\n",
        "####Why python is popular\n",
        "\n",
        "     It has been a favourite choice amongst the new workforce; be it web development or data science as it gives an easier understanding. It is easier for the beginners to learn. It does not need a person with a technical background, Person with non technical background can also learn it easily.\n",

        "\n",
        " 2. **What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- An interpreter in python language is a program that directly executes python codes converting line by line instructions to machine readable instructions.  \n",
        "\n",
        " For example: when we write print(\"hello world\") in python, the interpreter automatically understands print as a function and display \"hello world\".\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Predefined keywords used in python language are those reserved words which are used to have some specific meanings and functions. These are very important for the working of a code in python.\n",
        "\n",
        " One can have the access to predefined keywords by writing help(\"keywords\") in python.\n",
        " These keywords cannot be used as identifiers because of their specific role predefined.\n",
        " For example: await, break, if, else, elif, while, not, and, etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",

        "  Using keywords as variables can cause syntax errors.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "- Mutability in python refers to the ability of a content to be changed after its creation. These are those values that can be modified in place after they were initialized.\n",
        "\n",
        " Examples of mutable items are: lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "- Lists and tuples looks similar but they are not. They may look similar but the difference lies in the **parentheses** and **immutability**. The items in list are mutable whereas items in a tuple are immutable, this is because the developers wanted to give some sense of security to the data. As if any data is stored in a tuple then there will be less chances of it to be altered in the future by mistake.\n",
        "\n",
        " If you store objects in a list, there are chances that some other method will accidentally alter it and break your method, but a tuple offers a guarantee that the object you have stored will remain fixed. So the content that a developer want to keep immutable are kept in tuple and the one which it wants to alter are kept in lists or dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n",
        "- both \"==\" and \"is\" operators in pyhton are used for comparison but they serve diffrent purposes as well.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  \"==\" operator- It checks for equality of values that evaluates wheter two objects are same or not.\n",
        "\n",
        " - \"is\" operator- It checks for identity, i.e it signifies that the two variables determine to the same variable in the memory or not. If they are same then \"True\" statement is depicted otherwise a \"False\" statement is depicted.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Operators in python are spercial symbols that perform operations on one or more operands. Logical operators is a type of operator among several operators of python.\n",
        "####Logical operators-\n",
        "  Python offers three fundamdental logical operators: \"and\", \"or\" and \"not\". They evaluate the overall truth value of expressions, typically resulting in a Boolean True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "- Type casting means changing of data manually using built in fucntions of python or in simple words the process of converting one data type to another. It is done when there is an need to change the representation of a value.  It is of two types --Implicit type casting and Explicit type casting.\n",

        "-  1. Implicit type casting- In this data is converted to another data type automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Explicit type casting- In this data is converted manually commanding the python by using data functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Many a times a certain condition arises where more than one outcomes are possbile so for that case python enable us to use conditional statements for implementing any of the favourable outcome we want. This enables decision making within the code. Examples of conditional statements are- if, else, and elif.\n",
        "12.  **How does the elif statement work?**\n",
        "- Elif statement in python means 'else if'. It is used to check multiple conditions simultaneously. It is apython way of saying that the previous conditions were not true hence try another condition until the right one is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  **What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n",
        "- A Loop in python is a block of code that commands a code to repeatedly execute itself. It is helpful in tasks related to automation.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. For loop- It is used usually when the number of  iterations are previously known.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. While loop- It is used when the iterations are not known beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  **Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?**\n",
        "- a while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations are not known.\n",
        "\n",
        " One scenario where while loop will be more suitable than for loop is playing a game. As we do not know when the game is gonna end, it might end in 2 minutes by completion of a certain level or it might go for hours. So in that case a while loop is used and it continues until the game ends.\n",
        "\n",
        " or\n",
        "\n",
        " Suppose there is a file consisting a lot of rows, we dont know till how long we havw to perform a task so in that case we will use while loop and it will continue to execute code till the rows ends.\n",
